 abstract = {Interannual variability of vegetation activity (i.e.,
photosynthesis) is strongly correlated with El Niño Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). Globally, a reduction in carbon uptake by
terrestrial ecosystems has been observed during the ENSO warm
phase (El Niño) and the opposite during the cold phase (La Ni
ña). However, this global perspective obscures the
heterogeneous impacts of ENSO at regional scales. Particularly,
ENSO has contrasting impacts on climate in northern South America
(NSA) depending on the ENSO phase and geographical location,
which in turn affect the activity of vegetation. Furthermore,
changes of vegetation activity during multiple ENSO events are
not well understood yet. In this study, we investigated the
spatial and temporal differences in vegetation activity
associated with ENSO variability and its three phases (El Niñ
o, La Niña, Neutral) to identify hotspots of ENSO impacts in
NSA, a region dominated by rainforest and savannas. To achieve
this, we investigated time series of vegetation variables from
2001 to 2014 at moderate spatial resolution (0.0083°
). Data were aggregated through dimensionality reduction analysis
(i.e., Global Principal Component Analysis). The leading
principal component served as a proxy of vegetation activity
(VAC). We calculated the cross-correlation between VAC and the
multivariate ENSO index separately for each ENSO phase. Our
results show that El Niño phase has a stronger impact on
vegetation activity both in intensity and duration than La Niñ
a phase. Moreover, seasonally dry ecoregions were more
susceptible to El Niño impacts on vegetation activity.
Understanding these differences is key for regional adaptation
and differentiated management of ecosystems.},
