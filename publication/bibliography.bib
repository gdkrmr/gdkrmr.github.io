  abstract =     {Compared to other natural disasters, climate-related extremes
                  like droughts and heat waves have the largest impacts on human
                  well-being at the global scale. Given that droughts are
                  expected to intensify over the next decades, that other
                  extreme events may happen more frequently, and that global
                  population growth already now leads to a higher exposure and
                  humanity faces major challenges. A fundamental question
                  related to these critical global developments is whether
                  increasing wealth levels could partly offset this phenomenon.
                  In order to investigate this question systematically and at
                  the global level we need to consolidate multiple data sets
                  that are required in the respective global empirical analyses.
                  In this contribution we review this challenge. We argue that
                  an objective assessment of trends in global disaster risk due
                  to climate extremes requires (1) accurate regional disaster
                  impact data of extreme events, (2) local demographic and
                  socioeconomic indicators, for example, on poverty, inequality,
                  and education to understand the societal vulnerability, and
                  (3) high-level information on the exact spatiotemporal
                  dynamics of the climate extreme, its return-time probability,
                  and its impacts on ecosystem services. We outline a path
                  toward an integrated assessment of natural disasters that
                  requires bridging the wide disciplinary gaps to understand the
                  full cascade from climate extremes to human impacts.},
