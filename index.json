Its unique visual representation has been key to the development of the concept and its dissemination. In this commentary, we outline three areas of concern to facilitate further enhancement in the PB concept's visualisation. First, the radial bar plot leads to a quadratic scaling of the effect sizes. Second, the colour gradations denoting the risk of each boundary transgression use complex non-linear patterns, which complicates interpretation. Third, non-linearly distorted colour scales and their fading make the visual perception for people suffering from colour-vision deficiency even more challenging or impossible. The conjunction of quadratic effect scaling and specific colour coding may unintentionally amplify the perception of high-risk areas. We recommend a careful revision of the visual language employed in PB communication. Addressing these concerns will make the PB visualisation a more accurate base for decision-makers.","tags":[],"title":"Cautionary Remarks on the Planetary Boundary Visualisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Montero","Guido Kraemer","Anca Anghelea","César Aybar","Gunnar Brandt","Gustau Camps-Valls","Felix Cremer","Ida Flik","Fabian Gans","Sarah Habershon","Chaonan Ji","Teja Kattenborn","Laura Martínez-Ferrer","Francesco Martinuzzi","Martin Reinhardt","Maximilian Söchting","Khalil Teber","Miguel D.

Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) have emerged as one suitable solution for transforming this flood of data into a simple yet robust data structure. ESDCs achieve this by organising data into an analysis-ready format aligned with a spatio-temporal grid, facilitating user-friendly analysis and diminishing the need for extensive technical data processing knowledge. Despite these significant benefits, the completion of the entire ESDC life cycle remains a challenging task. Obstacles are not only of a technical nature but also relate to domain-specific problems in Earth system research. There exist barriers to realising the full potential of data collections in light of novel cloud-based technologies, particularly in curating data tailored for specific application domains. These include transforming data to conform to a spatio-temporal grid with minimum distortions and managing complexities such as spatio-temporal autocorrelation issues. Addressing these challenges is pivotal for the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches. Furthermore, adhering to open science principles for data dissemination, reproducibility, visualisation, and reuse is crucial for fostering sustainable research. Overcoming these challenges offers a substantial opportunity to advance data-driven Earth system research, unlocking the full potential of an integrated, multidimensional view of Earth system processes.

We uncovered the complexity of this event using hydroclimatic data, remote sensing, cell counts, hydrochemical and toxin analyses, and genetics.

The dramatic losses of large filter feeders and the spreading of vegetative cells and resting stages make the system more susceptible to new harmful algal blooms.

Today, mobile applications with automated species identification open new possibilities for phenological monitoring across space and time. Here, we introduce an innovative spatio-temporal machine learning methodology that harnesses such crowd-sourced data to quantify phenological dynamics across taxa, space and time. Our algorithm links individual phenological responses across thousands of species and geographical locations, using a similarity measure. The analysis draws on nearly ten million plant observations collected through the AI-based plant identification app Flora Incognita in Germany from 2018 to 2021. Our method quantifies changes in synchronisation across the annual cycle. During the growing season, synchronised behaviour can be encoded by a few characteristic macrophenological patterns. Nonlinear spatio-temporal changes of these patterns can be efficiently quantified using a data compressibility measure. Outside the growing season, the phenological synchronisation diminishes introducing noise into the patterns. Despite biases and uncertainties associated with crowd-sourced data, for example due to human data collection behaviour, our study demonstrates the feasibility of deriving meaningful indicators for monitoring plant macrophenology from individual plant observations. As crowd-sourced databases continue to expand, our approach holds promise to study climate-induced phenological shifts and feedback loops.","tags":["citizen science","Isomap","machine learning","macroecology","macrophenology","nonlinear dimension reduction","plant phenology","spatio-temporal dynamics"],"title":"Macrophenological Dynamics from Citizen Science Plant Occurrence Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lina M.

Globally, a reduction in carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems has been observed during the ENSO warm phase (El Niño) and the opposite during the cold phase (La Ni ña). However, this global perspective obscures the heterogeneous impacts of ENSO at regional scales. Particularly, ENSO has contrasting impacts on climate in northern South America (NSA) depending on the ENSO phase and geographical location, which in turn affect the activity of vegetation. Furthermore, changes of vegetation activity during multiple ENSO events are not well understood yet. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal differences in vegetation activity associated with ENSO variability and its three phases (El Niñ o, La Niña, Neutral) to identify hotspots of ENSO impacts in NSA, a region dominated by rainforest and savannas. To achieve this, we investigated time series of vegetation variables from 2001 to 2014 at moderate spatial resolution (0.0083° ). Data were aggregated through dimensionality reduction analysis (i.e., Global Principal Component Analysis). The leading principal component served as a proxy of vegetation activity (VAC). We calculated the cross-correlation between VAC and the multivariate ENSO index separately for each ENSO phase. Our results show that El Niño phase has a stronger impact on vegetation activity both in intensity and duration than La Niñ a phase. Moreover, seasonally dry ecoregions were more susceptible to El Niño impacts on vegetation activity. Understanding these differences is key for regional adaptation and differentiated management of ecosystems.","tags":["biodiversity hotspots","dimensionality reduction analysis","ENSO","lagged effects","northern south America","tropical ecosystems","vegetation activity"],"title":"Spatial Patterns of Vegetation Activity Related to ENSO in  Northern South America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia S.

However, global trait databases are sparse because they are compiled from many, mostly small databases. This sparsity in both trait space completeness and geographical distribution limits the potential for both multivariate and global analyses. Thus, `gap-filling' approaches are often used to impute missing trait data. Recent methods, like Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization (BHPMF), can impute large and sparse data sets using side information. We investigate whether BHPMF imputation leads to biases in trait space and identify aspects influencing bias to provide guidance for its usage. Innovation We use a fully observed trait data set from which entries are randomly removed, along with extensive but sparse additional data. We use BHPMF for imputation and evaluate bias by: (1) accuracy (residuals, RMSE, trait means), (2) correlations (bi- and multivariate) and (3) taxonomic and functional clustering (valuewise, uni- and multivariate). BHPMF preserves general patterns of trait distributions but induces taxonomic clustering. Data set– external trait data had little effect on induced taxonomic clustering and stabilized trait– trait correlations. Main Conclusions Our study extends the criteria for the evaluation of gap-filling beyond RMSE, providing insight into statistical data structure and allowing better informed use of imputed trait data, with improved practice for imputation. We expect our findings to be valuable beyond applications in plant ecology, for any study using hierarchical side information for imputation.","tags":["Bayesian hierarchical model","gap-filling","imputation","induced pattern","machine learning","matrix factorization","plant functional trait","sensitivity analysis","sparse matrix","TRY"],"title":"Imputing Missing Data in Plant Traits: A Guide to Improve Gap-Filling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Introduction to R Principles of data visualization Intro to R basic plotting Intro to ggplot Global socieconomic data – from tables to maps.

Proposed approaches often rely on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), linking the heterogeneity of terrestrial vegetation to the variability of the spectroradiometric signals. Yet, due to observational limitations, the SVH has been insufficiently tested, remaining unclear which metrics, methods, and sensors could provide the most reliable estimates of plant biodiversity. Here we assessed the potential of RS to infer plant biodiversity using radiative transfer simulations and inversion. We focused specifically on ``functional diversity,'' which represents the spatial variability in plant functional traits. First, we simulated vegetation communities and evaluated the information content of different functional diversity metrics (FDMs) derived from their optical reflectance factors (R) or the corresponding vegetation ``optical traits,'' estimated via radiative transfer model inversion. Second, we assessed the effect of the spatial resolution, the spectral characteristics of the sensor, and signal noise on the relationships between FDMs derived from field and remote sensing datasets. Finally, we evaluated the plausibility of the simulations using Sentinel-2 (multispectral, 10~m pixel) and DESIS (hyperspectral, 30~m pixel) imagery acquired over sites of the Functional Significance of Forest Biodiversity in Europe (FunDivEUROPE) network. We demonstrate that functional diversity can be inferred both by reflectance and optical traits. However, not all the FDMs tested were suited for assessing plant functional diversity from RS. Rao's Q index, functional dispersion, and functional richness were the best-performing metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrated that spatial resolution is the most limiting RS feature. In agreement with simulations, Sentinel-2 imagery provided better estimates of plant diversity than DESIS, despite the coarser spectral resolution. However, Sentinel-2 offered inaccurate results at DESIS spatial resolution. Overall, our results identify the strengths and weaknesses of optical RS to monitor plant functional diversity.

Tackling the accelerated human-induced biodiversity loss requires tools able to map biodiversity and its changes globally. Remote sensing (RS) offers unique capabilities of characterizing Earth surfaces; therefore, it could map plant biodiversity continuously and globally. This approach is supported by the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), which states that spectra and species (taxonomic and trait) diversities are linked through environmental heterogeneity. In this work, we evaluate the capability of the DESIS hyperspectral imager to capture plant diversity patterns as measured in dedicated plots of the network FunDivEUROPE. We computed functional and taxonomical diversity metrics from field taxonomic, structural, and foliar measurements in vegetation plots sampled in Spain and Romania. In addition, we also computed functional diversity metrics both from the DESIS reflectance factors and from vegetation parameters estimated via inversion of a radiative transfer model. Results showed that only metrics computed from spectral reflectance were able to capture taxonomic variability in the area. However, the lack of sensitivity was related to the insufficient plot size and the lack of spatial match between remote sensing and field data, but also the differences between the information contained in the field traits and remote sensing data, and the potential uncertainties in the remote estimates of vegetation parameters. Thus, while DESIS showed some sensitivity to plant diversity, further efforts are needed to deploy suitable biodiversity evaluation and validation plots and networks that support the development of biodiversity remote sensing products.\n","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the Potential of DESIS to Infer Plant Taxonomical and Functional Diversities in European Forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; wird immer wichtiger in allen Bereichen in der Forschung und Wirtschaft.

Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities. However, the axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental variability. Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions from a dataset of surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to accurately predict the full range of responses~to environmental changes in carbon, water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"The Three Major Axes of Terrestrial Ecosystem Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel D.

However, terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere interact via a multitude of variables across temporal and spatial scales. Additionally these interactions might differ among vegetation types or climatic regions. Today, novel algorithms aim to disentangle the causal structure behind such interactions from empirical data. The estimated causal structures can be interpreted as networks, where nodes represent relevant meteorological variables or land-surface fluxes and the links represent the dependencies among them (possibly including time lags and link strength). Here we derived causal networks for different seasons at 119 eddy covariance flux tower observations in the FLUXNET network. We show that the networks of biosphere– atmosphere interactions are strongly shaped by meteorological conditions. For example, we find that temperate and high-latitude ecosystems during peak productivity exhibit biosphere– atmosphere interaction networks very similar to tropical forests. In times of anomalous conditions like droughts though, both ecosystems behave more like typical Mediterranean ecosystems during their dry season. Our results demonstrate that ecosystems from different climate zones or vegetation types have similar biosphere– atmosphere interactions if their meteorological conditions are similar. We anticipate our analysis to foster the use of network approaches, as they allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the state of ecosystem functioning. Long-term or even irreversible changes in network structure are rare and thus can be indicators of fundamental functional ecosystem shifts.$$","tags":[],"title":"Functional Convergence of Biosphere– Atmosphere Interactions in Response to Meteorological Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Kraemer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627989591,"objectID":"87368b3fb3942ae2c1f41cceff4bc442","permalink":"https://gdkrmr.github.io/publication/kraemer-lowdimensional-2020/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T11:19:51.141604Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kraemer-lowdimensional-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In times of global change, we must closely monitor the state of our planet in order to understand gradual or abrupt changes early on. In fact, each of the Earth's subsystems-i.e. the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and anthroposphere-can be analyzed from a multitude of data streams. However, since it is very hard to jointly interpret multiple monitoring data streams in parallel, one often aims for some summarizing indicator. Climate indices, for example, summarize the state of atmospheric circulation in a region, e.g. the Multivariate ENSO (El Ñino-Southern Oscillation) Index. Indicator approaches have been used extensively to describe socioeconomic data too, and a range of indices have been proposed to synthesize and interpret this information. For instance the \\\"Human Development Index\\\" (HDI) by the United Nations Development Programme was designed to capture specific aspects of development.  \\\"Dimensionality reduction\\\" (DR) is a widely used approach to find low dimensional and interpretable representations of data that are natively embedded in high-dimensional spaces. Here, we propose a robust method to create indicators using dimensionality reduction to better represent the terrestrial biosphere and the global socioeconomic system. We aim to explore the performance of the approach and to interpret the resulting indicators.  For biosphere indicators, the concept was tested using 12 explanatory variables representing the biophysical states of ecosystems and land-atmosphere water, energy, and carbon fluxes. We find that two indicators account for 73% of the variance of the state of the biosphere in space and time. While the first indicator summarizes productivity patterns, the second indicator summarizes variables representing water and energy availability. Anomalies in the indicators clearly identify extreme events, such as the Amazon droughts (2005 and 2010) and the Russian heatwave (2010), they also allow us to interpret the impacts of these events. The indicators also reveal changes in the seasonal cycle, e.g. increasing seasonal amplitudes of productivity in agricultural areas and in arctic regions.  We also apply the method on the \\\"World Development Indicators\\\", a database with more than 1500 variables, to track the socioeconomic development at a country level. The aim was to extract the core dimensions of development in a highly efficient way, using a method of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We find that over 90% of variance in the WDIs can be represented by five uncorrelated and nonlinear dimensions. The first dimension (explaining 74%) represents the state of education, health, income, infrastructure, trade, population, and pollution. The second dimension (explaining 10%) differentiates countries by gender ratios, labor market, and energy production patterns. Overall, we find that the data contained in the WDIs are highly nonlinear therefore requiring nonlinear methods to extract the main patterns of development. Globally, most countries show rather consistent temporal trends towards wealthier and aging societies. Deviations from the long-term trajectories are detected with our approach during warfare, environmental disasters, or fundamental political changes.  In general we find that the indicator approach is able to extract general patterns from complex databases and that it can be applied to databases of varying characteristics. We also find that indicators are can different kinds of changes occurring in the system, such as extreme events, permanent changes or trends. Therefore it is a useful tool for general monitoring and exploratory data analysis. The approach is flexible and can be applied to complex datasets, such as large data, nonlinear data, as well as data with many missing values.","tags":[],"title":"Low-Dimensional Representations of Earth System Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; wird immer wichtiger in allen Bereichen in der Forschung und Wirtschaft.

ENSO warm and cold phases, El Niño and La Niña respectively, cause contrasting climatic conditions along tropical South America. While some regions experience wetter conditions during El Niño, such as the Pacific coast, others regions such as the Amazon are exposed to warmer and drier climates. Besides this spatial variation, the biospheric response also differs between ENSO type and intensity, overruling of local conditions and ecosystems types. Due to this complexity, there is a lack of understanding on what ecosystems and regions are systematically affected by ENSO and how biospheric variables respond. Here, we analysed the Northern region of tropical South America covering tropical savannas, forests, and mountainous ecosystems in several countries. To do this, we assessed different land surface (e.g. GPP, NDVI, FPAR, LST) and climate data streams compiled in the regional Earth System Data Lab (ESDL, https://www.earthsystemdatalab.net/) at 1 km and 10 km pixel size from 2001 to 2015. We applied Isomap, a non-linear dimensionality reduction method in the time domain for high dimensional dynamical systems. Our analysis was constrained to the fourth order continental basins and dominant land cover types. Land use change pixels were disregarded. Further, a comparison of ENSO indexes was conducted among basins. We found that isomap components are able to capture the biosphere variability related to ENSO in basins that have been historically affected such as Magdalena-Cauca valleys and the Caribbean region. Implementation of non-linear methods increases our understanding of ENSO impacts spatially in regions where events intensity and frequency is increasing, and effective ecosystems management is urgent.","tags":[],"title":"Capturing the Influence of ENSO on Land Surface Variables for Tropical South America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose E.

Modeling the complex interactions among variables in both space and time is a constant and challenging endevour.

Despite great advances in classification and regression, learning from data seems an ilusive problem in machine learning for the Earth sciences. The hardest part turns out to be the extraction of their relevant information and figuring out reliable models for summarizing, modeling, and understanding variables and parameters of interest.We introduce the use of machine learning techniques to bring systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to light purely from data. Learning ODEs from stochastic variables is a challenging problem, and hence studied scarcely in the literature. Sparse regression algorithms allow us to explore the space of solutions of ODEs from data. Owing to the Occam's razor, and exploiting extra physics-aware regularization, the presented method identifies the most expressive and simplest ODEs explaining the data. From the learned ODE, one not only learns the underlying dynamical equation governing the system, but standard analysis allows us to also infer collapse, turning points, and stability regions of the system. We illustrate the methodology using some particular remote sensing datasets quantifying biosphere and vegetation status. These analytical equations come to be self-explanatory models which may provide insight into these particular Earth Subsystems.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Ordinary Differential Equations from Remote Sensing Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel D.

The idea is that treating multiple data dimensions, such as spatial, temporal, variable, frequency, and other grids alike, allows effective application of user-defined functions to co-interpret Earth observations and/or model– data integration. An implementation of this concept combines analysis-ready data cubes with a suitable analytic interface. In three case studies, we demonstrate how the concept and its implementation facilitate the execution of complex workflows for research across multiple variables, and spatial and temporal scales: (1) summary statistics for ecosystem and climate dynamics; (2) intrinsic dimensionality analysis on multiple timescales; and (3) model– data integration. We discuss the emerging perspectives for investigating global interacting and coupled phenomena in observed or simulated data. In particular, we see many emerging perspectives of this approach for interpreting large-scale model ensembles. The latest developments in machine learning, causal inference, and model– data integration can be seamlessly implemented in the proposed framework, supporting rapid progress in data-intensive research across disciplinary boundaries.","tags":null,"title":"Earth System Data Cubes Unravel Global Multivariate Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel D.

Given that droughts are expected to intensify over the next decades, that other extreme events may happen more frequently, and that global population growth already now leads to a higher exposure and humanity faces major challenges. A fundamental question related to these critical global developments is whether increasing wealth levels could partly offset this phenomenon. In order to investigate this question systematically and at the global level we need to consolidate multiple data sets that are required in the respective global empirical analyses. In this contribution we review this challenge. We argue that an objective assessment of trends in global disaster risk due to climate extremes requires (1) accurate regional disaster impact data of extreme events, (2) local demographic and socioeconomic indicators, for example, on poverty, inequality, and education to understand the societal vulnerability, and (3) high-level information on the exact spatiotemporal dynamics of the climate extreme, its return-time probability, and its impacts on ecosystem services. We outline a path toward an integrated assessment of natural disasters that requires bridging the wide disciplinary gaps to understand the full cascade from climate extremes to human impacts.","tags":["Climate hazards","EM-DAT","Humanitarian disasters"],"title":"Data Challenges Limit Our Global Understanding of Humanitarian Disasters Triggered by Climate Extremes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Datenschutz Ich sammle keinerlei Daten.

The packages also provide quality indicators for the embeddings and easy visualization of high dimensional data. The coRanking package provides the functionality for assessing DR methods in the co-ranking matrix framework. In tandem, these packages allow for uncovering complex structures high dimensional data. Currently 15 DR methods are available in the package, some of which were not previously available to R users.

Here, we review the capacity of Colombia to monitor the state of its ecosystems and their rate of change over time. We found several important programs currently set in place by different institutions as well as by independent groups of scientists that address different aspects of environmental monitoring. However, most of the current initiatives could be improved in terms of data coverage, quality and access, and could be better articulated among each other. We propose a set of activities that would increase the capacity of Colombia to monitor its ecosystems, provide useful information to policy makers, and facilitate scientific research. These include: 1) the establishment of a national center for ecological synthesis that focuses on analyzing existing information; 2) the establishment of an ecological observatory system that collects new information, integrates remote sensing products, and produces near real-time products on key ecological variables; and 3) the creation of new platforms for dialog and action within existing

However, little is known of the age of stored C and the degree to which it supports respiration in general. We used bomb radiocarbon (14C) measurements to determine the mean age of carbon in CO2 emitted from and within stems of three tropical tree species in Peru. Carbon pools fixed $$1 year previously contributed to stem CO2 efflux in all trees investigated, in both dry and wet seasons. The average age, i.e., the time elapsed since original fixation of CO2 from the atmosphere by the plant to its loss from the stem, ranged from 0 to 6 years. The average age of CO2 sampled 5-cm deep within the stems ranged from 2 to 6 years for two of the three species, while CO2 in the stem of the third tree species was fixed from 14 to $$20 years previously. Given the consistency of 14C values observed for individuals within each species, it is unlikely that decomposition is the source of the older CO2. Our results are in accordance with other studies that have demonstrated the contribution of storage reserves to the construction of stem wood and root respiration in temperate and boreal forests. We postulate the high 14C values observed in stem CO2 efflux and stem-internal CO2 result from respiration of storage C pools within the tree. The observed age differences between emitted and stem-internal CO2 indicate an age gradient for sources of CO2 within the tree: CO2 produced in the outer region of the stem is younger, originating from more recent assimilates, whereas the CO2 found deeper within the stem is older, fueled by several-year-old C pools. The CO2 emitted at the stem– atmosphere interface represents a mixture of young and old CO2. These observations were independent of season, even during a time of severe regional drought. Therefore, we postulate that the use of storage C for respiration occurs on a regular basis challenging the assumption that storage pools serve as substrates for respiration only during times of limited assimilation.","tags":["bomb radiocarbon 14C","non-structural carbohydrates","storage carbon pools","tree respiration"],"title":"Carbon Dioxide Emitted from Live Stems of Tropical Trees Is Several Years Old","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Kraemer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627989590,"objectID":"875dcab93cb42ab3aec7e7c4e8ca0bc1","permalink":"https://gdkrmr.github.io/publication/kraemer-aplicacion-2013/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T11:19:50.714331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kraemer-aplicacion-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Se desarrolló una metodología para determinar el impacto de un índice climático sobre una variable local, se probó la metodología utilizando el Índice Oceánico El Niño (ONI) sobre los niveles máximos y mínimos trimestrales del Río Mazán tomados en la estación hidrológica Puerto Alegre.

The rate of CO2 efflux from the stem has often been assumed to be a measure of stem respiration. However, recent work in temperate forests has demonstrated that stem CO2 efflux can either overestimate or underestimate respiration rate because of emission or removal of CO2 by transport in xylem water. Here, we studied gas exchange from stems of tropical forest trees using a new approach to better understand respiration in an ecosystem that plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Our main questions were (1) is internal CO2 transport important in tropical trees, and, if so, (2) does this transport result in net release of CO2 respired in the roots at the stem, or does it cause the opposite effect of net removal of stem-respired CO2? To answer these questions, we measured the ratio of stem CO2 efflux to O2 influx. This ratio, defined here as apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ), is expected to equal 1.0 if carbohydrates are the substrate for respiration, and the net transport of CO2 in the xylem water is negligible. Using a stem chamber approach to quantifying ARQ, we found values of 0.66 $±$ 0.18. These low ARQ values indicate that a large portion of respired CO2 (~ 35%) is not emitted locally, and is probably transported upward in the stem. ARQ values of 0.21 $±$ 0.10 were found for the steady-state gas concentration within the stem, sampled by in-stem equilibration probes. These lower values may result from the proximity to the xylem water stream. In contrast, we found ARQ values of 1.00 $±$ 0.13 for soil respiration. Our results indicate the existence of a considerable internal flux of CO2 in the stems of tropical trees. If the transported CO2 is used in the canopy as a substrate for photosynthesis, it could account for up to 10% of the C fixed by the tree, and perhaps serve as a mechanism that buffers the response of the tree to changing CO2 levels. Our results also indicate, in agreement with previous work, that the widely used CO2 efflux approach for determining stem respiration is unreliable. We demonstrate here a field applicable approach for measuring the O2 uptake rate, which we suggest to be a more appropriate method to estimate stem respiration rates.","tags":null,"title":"Internal Respiration of Amazon Tree Stems Greatly Exceeds External CO2 Efflux","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alon Angert","Jan Muhr","Robinson Negron Juarez","Waldemar Alegria Muñoz","Guido Kraemer","J.

The measurements included tropical forest trees, which are major contributors to the global fluxes of carbon and oxygen. We found discrimination in the range of 12.6– 21.5‰, indicating both diffusion limitation, resulting in O2 discrimination values below 20‰, and alternative oxidase respiration, which resulted in discrimination values greater than 20‰. Discrimination varied seasonally, between and within tree species.
