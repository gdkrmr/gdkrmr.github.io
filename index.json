Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities. However, the axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental variability. Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions from a dataset of surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to accurately predict the full range of responses~to environmental changes in carbon, water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.","tags":[],"title":"The Three Major Axes of Terrestrial Ecosystem Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Kraemer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627989591,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627989591,"objectID":"87368b3fb3942ae2c1f41cceff4bc442","permalink":"https://gdkrmr.github.io/publication/kraemer-lowdimensional-2020/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T11:19:51.141604Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kraemer-lowdimensional-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In times of global change, we must closely monitor the state of our planet in order to understand gradual or abrupt changes early on. In fact, each of the Earth's subsystems-i.e. the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and anthroposphere-can be analyzed from a multitude of data streams. However, since it is very hard to jointly interpret multiple monitoring data streams in parallel, one often aims for some summarizing indicator. Climate indices, for example, summarize the state of atmospheric circulation in a region, e.g. the Multivariate ENSO (El Ñino-Southern Oscillation) Index. Indicator approaches have been used extensively to describe socioeconomic data too, and a range of indices have been proposed to synthesize and interpret this information. For instance the \\\"Human Development Index\\\" (HDI) by the United Nations Development Programme was designed to capture specific aspects of development.  \\\"Dimensionality reduction\\\" (DR) is a widely used approach to find low dimensional and interpretable representations of data that are natively embedded in high-dimensional spaces. Here, we propose a robust method to create indicators using dimensionality reduction to better represent the terrestrial biosphere and the global socioeconomic system. We aim to explore the performance of the approach and to interpret the resulting indicators.  For biosphere indicators, the concept was tested using 12 explanatory variables representing the biophysical states of ecosystems and land-atmosphere water, energy, and carbon fluxes. We find that two indicators account for 73% of the variance of the state of the biosphere in space and time. While the first indicator summarizes productivity patterns, the second indicator summarizes variables representing water and energy availability. Anomalies in the indicators clearly identify extreme events, such as the Amazon droughts (2005 and 2010) and the Russian heatwave (2010), they also allow us to interpret the impacts of these events. The indicators also reveal changes in the seasonal cycle, e.g. increasing seasonal amplitudes of productivity in agricultural areas and in arctic regions.  We also apply the method on the \\\"World Development Indicators\\\", a database with more than 1500 variables, to track the socioeconomic development at a country level. The aim was to extract the core dimensions of development in a highly efficient way, using a method of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We find that over 90% of variance in the WDIs can be represented by five uncorrelated and nonlinear dimensions. The first dimension (explaining 74%) represents the state of education, health, income, infrastructure, trade, population, and pollution. The second dimension (explaining 10%) differentiates countries by gender ratios, labor market, and energy production patterns. Overall, we find that the data contained in the WDIs are highly nonlinear therefore requiring nonlinear methods to extract the main patterns of development. Globally, most countries show rather consistent temporal trends towards wealthier and aging societies. Deviations from the long-term trajectories are detected with our approach during warfare, environmental disasters, or fundamental political changes.  In general we find that the indicator approach is able to extract general patterns from complex databases and that it can be applied to databases of varying characteristics. We also find that indicators are can different kinds of changes occurring in the system, such as extreme events, permanent changes or trends. Therefore it is a useful tool for general monitoring and exploratory data analysis. The approach is flexible and can be applied to complex datasets, such as large data, nonlinear data, as well as data with many missing values.","tags":[],"title":"Low-Dimensional Representations of Earth System Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Kraemer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627989590,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627989590,"objectID":"03a230a5f4b52a055492a905003d08e6","permalink":"https://gdkrmr.github.io/publication/kraemer-drivers-2015/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T11:19:50.802998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kraemer-drivers-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Drivers of Diversity and Functional Characteristics in Broadleaf Forests – the Example of Thuringia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel D.

The question we address here is whether such crowd-sourced data contain substantial macroecological information. In particular, we aim to understand if we can detect known environmental gradients shaping plant co-occurrences. In this study we analysed 1 million data points collected through the use of the mobile app Flora Incognita between 2018 and 2019 in Germany and compared them with Florkart, containing plant occurrence data collected by more than 5000 floristic experts over a 70-year period. The direct comparison of the two data sets reveals that the crowd-sourced data particularly undersample areas of low population density. However, using nonlinear dimensionality reduction we were able to uncover macroecological patterns in both data sets that correspond well to each other. Mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality and wind dynamics as well as soil water content and soil texture represent the most important gradients shaping species composition in both data collections. Our analysis describes one way of how automated species identification could soon enable near real-time monitoring of macroecological patterns and their changes, but also discusses biases that must be carefully considered before crowd-sourced biodiversity data can effectively guide conservation measures.","tags":["\"automated species identification\"","\"canonical correlation analysis\"","\"citizen science\"","\"floristic survey\"","\"macroecological patterns\"","\"nonlinear dimensionality reduction\""],"title":"Crowd-Sourced Plant Occurrence Data Provide a Reliable Description of Macroecological Gradients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Krich","Mirco Migliavacca","Diego G.

However, terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere interact via a multitude of variables across temporal and spatial scales. Additionally these interactions might differ among vegetation types or climatic regions. Today, novel algorithms aim to disentangle the causal structure behind such interactions from empirical data. The estimated causal structures can be interpreted as networks, where nodes represent relevant meteorological variables or land-surface fluxes and the links represent the dependencies among them (possibly including time lags and link strength). Here we derived causal networks for different seasons at 119 eddy covariance flux tower observations in the FLUXNET network. We show that the networks of biosphere– atmosphere interactions are strongly shaped by meteorological conditions. For example, we find that temperate and high-latitude ecosystems during peak productivity exhibit biosphere– atmosphere interaction networks very similar to tropical forests. In times of anomalous conditions like droughts though, both ecosystems behave more like typical Mediterranean ecosystems during their dry season. Our results demonstrate that ecosystems from different climate zones or vegetation types have similar biosphere– atmosphere interactions if their meteorological conditions are similar. We anticipate our analysis to foster the use of network approaches, as they allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the state of ecosystem functioning. Long-term or even irreversible changes in network structure are rare and thus can be indicators of fundamental functional ecosystem shifts.$$","tags":[],"title":"Functional Convergence of Biosphere– Atmosphere Interactions in Response to Meteorological Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; wird immer wichtiger in allen Bereichen in der Forschung und Wirtschaft.

ENSO warm and cold phases, El Niño and La Niña respectively, cause contrasting climatic conditions along tropical South America. While some regions experience wetter conditions during El Niño, such as the Pacific coast, others regions such as the Amazon are exposed to warmer and drier climates. Besides this spatial variation, the biospheric response also differs between ENSO type and intensity, overruling of local conditions and ecosystems types. Due to this complexity, there is a lack of understanding on what ecosystems and regions are systematically affected by ENSO and how biospheric variables respond. Here, we analysed the Northern region of tropical South America covering tropical savannas, forests, and mountainous ecosystems in several countries. To do this, we assessed different land surface (e.g. GPP, NDVI, FPAR, LST) and climate data streams compiled in the regional Earth System Data Lab (ESDL, https://www.earthsystemdatalab.net/) at 1 km and 10 km pixel size from 2001 to 2015. We applied Isomap, a non-linear dimensionality reduction method in the time domain for high dimensional dynamical systems. Our analysis was constrained to the fourth order continental basins and dominant land cover types. Land use change pixels were disregarded. Further, a comparison of ENSO indexes was conducted among basins. We found that isomap components are able to capture the biosphere variability related to ENSO in basins that have been historically affected such as Magdalena-Cauca valleys and the Caribbean region. Implementation of non-linear methods increases our understanding of ENSO impacts spatially in regions where events intensity and frequency is increasing, and effective ecosystems management is urgent.","tags":[],"title":"Capturing the Influence of ENSO on Land Surface Variables for Tropical South America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose E.

Modeling the complex interactions among variables in both space and time is a constant and challenging endevour. When a clear mechanistic model of variable interaction and evolution is not available or uncertain, learning from data can be an alternative.Currently, Earth observation (EO) remote sensing data provides almost continuous space and time sampling of the Earth system which has been used to monitor our planet with advanced, semiautomatic algorithms able to classify and detect changes, and to retrieve relevant biogeophysical\u0026amp;#160;parameters of interest. Despite great advances in classification and regression, learning from data seems an ilusive problem in machine learning for the Earth sciences. The hardest part turns out to be the extraction of their relevant information and figuring out reliable models for summarizing, modeling, and understanding variables and parameters of interest.We introduce the use of machine learning techniques to bring systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to light purely from data. Learning ODEs from stochastic variables is a challenging problem, and hence studied scarcely in the literature. Sparse regression algorithms allow us to explore the space of solutions of ODEs from data. Owing to the Occam's razor, and exploiting extra physics-aware regularization, the presented method identifies the most expressive and simplest ODEs explaining the data. From the learned ODE, one not only learns the underlying dynamical equation governing the system, but standard analysis allows us to also infer collapse, turning points, and stability regions of the system. We illustrate the methodology using some particular remote sensing datasets quantifying biosphere and vegetation status.

The unprecedented availability of data streams describing different facets of the Earth now offers fundamentally new avenues to address this quest. However, several practical hurdles, especially the lack of data interoperability, limit the joint potential of these data streams. Today, many initiatives within and beyond the Earth system sciences are exploring new approaches to overcome these hurdles and meet the growing interdisciplinary need for data-intensive research; using data cubes is one promising avenue. Here, we introduce the concept of Earth system data cubes and how to operate on them in a formal way. The idea is that treating multiple data dimensions, such as spatial, temporal, variable, frequency, and other grids alike, allows effective application of user-defined functions to co-interpret Earth observations and/or model– data integration. An implementation of this concept combines analysis-ready data cubes with a suitable analytic interface. In three case studies, we demonstrate how the concept and its implementation facilitate the execution of complex workflows for research across multiple variables, and spatial and temporal scales: (1) summary statistics for ecosystem and climate dynamics; (2) intrinsic dimensionality analysis on multiple timescales; and (3) model– data integration. We discuss the emerging perspectives for investigating global interacting and coupled phenomena in observed or simulated data. In particular, we see many emerging perspectives of this approach for interpreting large-scale model ensembles. The latest developments in machine learning, causal inference, and model– data integration can be seamlessly implemented in the proposed framework, supporting rapid progress in data-intensive research across disciplinary boundaries.","tags":null,"title":"Earth System Data Cubes Unravel Global Multivariate Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel D.

Given that droughts are expected to intensify over the next decades, that other extreme events may happen more frequently, and that global population growth already now leads to a higher exposure and humanity faces major challenges. A fundamental question related to these critical global developments is whether increasing wealth levels could partly offset this phenomenon. In order to investigate this question systematically and at the global level we need to consolidate multiple data sets that are required in the respective global empirical analyses. In this contribution we review this challenge. We argue that an objective assessment of trends in global disaster risk due to climate extremes requires (1) accurate regional disaster impact data of extreme events, (2) local demographic and socioeconomic indicators, for example, on poverty, inequality, and education to understand the societal vulnerability, and (3) high-level information on the exact spatiotemporal dynamics of the climate extreme, its return-time probability, and its impacts on ecosystem services. We outline a path toward an integrated assessment of natural disasters that requires bridging the wide disciplinary gaps to understand the full cascade from climate extremes to human impacts.","tags":["Climate hazards","EM-DAT","Humanitarian disasters"],"title":"Data Challenges Limit Our Global Understanding of Humanitarian Disasters Triggered by Climate Extremes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Datenschutz Ich sammle keinerlei Daten.

The packages also provide quality indicators for the embeddings and easy visualization of high dimensional data. The coRanking package provides the functionality for assessing DR methods in the co-ranking matrix framework. In tandem, these packages allow for uncovering complex structures high dimensional data. Currently 15 DR methods are available in the package, some of which were not previously available to R users.

Here, we review the capacity of Colombia to monitor the state of its ecosystems and their rate of change over time. We found several important programs currently set in place by different institutions as well as by independent groups of scientists that address different aspects of environmental monitoring. However, most of the current initiatives could be improved in terms of data coverage, quality and access, and could be better articulated among each other. We propose a set of activities that would increase the capacity of Colombia to monitor its ecosystems, provide useful information to policy makers, and facilitate scientific research. These include: 1) the establishment of a national center for ecological synthesis that focuses on analyzing existing information; 2) the establishment of an ecological observatory system that collects new information, integrates remote sensing products, and produces near real-time products on key ecological variables; and 3) the creation of new platforms for dialog and action within existing

However, little is known of the age of stored C and the degree to which it supports respiration in general. We used bomb radiocarbon (14C) measurements to determine the mean age of carbon in CO2 emitted from and within stems of three tropical tree species in Peru. Carbon pools fixed $$1 year previously contributed to stem CO2 efflux in all trees investigated, in both dry and wet seasons. The average age, i.e., the time elapsed since original fixation of CO2 from the atmosphere by the plant to its loss from the stem, ranged from 0 to 6 years. The average age of CO2 sampled 5-cm deep within the stems ranged from 2 to 6 years for two of the three species, while CO2 in the stem of the third tree species was fixed from 14 to $$20 years previously. Given the consistency of 14C values observed for individuals within each species, it is unlikely that decomposition is the source of the older CO2. Our results are in accordance with other studies that have demonstrated the contribution of storage reserves to the construction of stem wood and root respiration in temperate and boreal forests. We postulate the high 14C values observed in stem CO2 efflux and stem-internal CO2 result from respiration of storage C pools within the tree. The observed age differences between emitted and stem-internal CO2 indicate an age gradient for sources of CO2 within the tree: CO2 produced in the outer region of the stem is younger, originating from more recent assimilates, whereas the CO2 found deeper within the stem is older, fueled by several-year-old C pools. The CO2 emitted at the stem– atmosphere interface represents a mixture of young and old CO2. These observations were independent of season, even during a time of severe regional drought. Therefore, we postulate that the use of storage C for respiration occurs on a regular basis challenging the assumption that storage pools serve as substrates for respiration only during times of limited assimilation.","tags":["bomb radiocarbon 14C","non-structural carbohydrates","storage carbon pools","tree respiration"],"title":"Carbon Dioxide Emitted from Live Stems of Tropical Trees Is Several Years Old","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guido Kraemer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627989590,"objectID":"875dcab93cb42ab3aec7e7c4e8ca0bc1","permalink":"https://gdkrmr.github.io/publication/kraemer-aplicacion-2013/","publishdate":"2021-08-03T11:19:50.714331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kraemer-aplicacion-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Se desarrolló una metodología para determinar el impacto de un índice climático sobre una variable local, se probó la metodología utilizando el Índice Oceánico El Niño (ONI) sobre los niveles máximos y mínimos trimestrales del Río Mazán tomados en la estación hidrológica Puerto Alegre.

The rate of CO2 efflux from the stem has often been assumed to be a measure of stem respiration. However, recent work in temperate forests has demonstrated that stem CO2 efflux can either overestimate or underestimate respiration rate because of emission or removal of CO2 by transport in xylem water. Here, we studied gas exchange from stems of tropical forest trees using a new approach to better understand respiration in an ecosystem that plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Our main questions were (1) is internal CO2 transport important in tropical trees, and, if so, (2) does this transport result in net release of CO2 respired in the roots at the stem, or does it cause the opposite effect of net removal of stem-respired CO2? To answer these questions, we measured the ratio of stem CO2 efflux to O2 influx. This ratio, defined here as apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ), is expected to equal 1.0 if carbohydrates are the substrate for respiration, and the net transport of CO2 in the xylem water is negligible. Using a stem chamber approach to quantifying ARQ, we found values of 0.66 $±$ 0.18. These low ARQ values indicate that a large portion of respired CO2 (~ 35%) is not emitted locally, and is probably transported upward in the stem. ARQ values of 0.21 $±$ 0.10 were found for the steady-state gas concentration within the stem, sampled by in-stem equilibration probes. These lower values may result from the proximity to the xylem water stream. In contrast, we found ARQ values of 1.00 $±$ 0.13 for soil respiration. Our results indicate the existence of a considerable internal flux of CO2 in the stems of tropical trees. If the transported CO2 is used in the canopy as a substrate for photosynthesis, it could account for up to 10% of the C fixed by the tree, and perhaps serve as a mechanism that buffers the response of the tree to changing CO2 levels. Our results also indicate, in agreement with previous work, that the widely used CO2 efflux approach for determining stem respiration is unreliable. We demonstrate here a field applicable approach for measuring the O2 uptake rate, which we suggest to be a more appropriate method to estimate stem respiration rates.","tags":null,"title":"Internal Respiration of Amazon Tree Stems Greatly Exceeds External CO2 Efflux","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alon Angert","Jan Muhr","Robinson Negron Juarez","Waldemar Alegria Muñoz","Guido Kraemer","J.

The measurements included tropical forest trees, which are major contributors to the global fluxes of carbon and oxygen. We found discrimination in the range of 12.6– 21.5‰, indicating both diffusion limitation, resulting in O2 discrimination values below 20‰, and alternative oxidase respiration, which resulted in discrimination values greater than 20‰.
